Worked with cross-functional teams to design and run A/B tests, analyzing data from 90,189 players to produce insights that improved user engagement and retention. Using Python, built a logistic regression model to predict day 1 and day 7 retention based on historical gaming data, driving key decisions and enhancing game design to strengthen retention strategies.
